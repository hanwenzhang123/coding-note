SELECT first_name, email FROM patrons WHERE library_id = 'MCL1001' ORR library_id = 'MCL1100' OR library_id = 'MCL1011';
SELECT first_name, email FROM patrons WHERE library_id IN ('MCL1001', 'MCL1100', 'MCL1011');

SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);

SELECT answer FROM answers WHERE id IN (7, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category NOT IN ("Electronics");
