Searching Within a Set of Values: Compare multiple values using IN(~~~)

SELECT first_name, email FROM patrons WHERE library_id = 'MCL1001' ORR library_id = 'MCL1100' OR library_id = 'MCL1011';
SELECT first_name, email FROM patrons WHERE library_id IN ('MCL1001', 'MCL1100', 'MCL1011');

SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column> IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);

Examples:
SELECT name FROM islands WHERE id IN (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ("eBooks", "Books", "Comics");
SELECT title FROM courses WHERE topic IN ("JavaScript", "Databases", "CSS");
SELECT * FROM campaigns WHERE medium IN ("email", "blog", "ppc");

To find all rows that are not in the set of values you can use NOT IN.
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <column>  NOT IN (<value 1>, <value 2>, ...);

Examples:
SELECT answer FROM answers WHERE id IN (7, 42);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category NOT IN ("Electronics");
SELECT title FROM courses WHERE topic NOT IN ("SQL", "NoSQL");
