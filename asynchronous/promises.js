//what is a promise? A promise represents the eventual completion of a asynchronous operation.
//A value that may not be available yet, like data requested from a server.
//Different between callbacks and promises
//A promise represents a value that can be handles at some point later
//Callback may leave us with some uncertainties about that value
//A promise will promise or guarantee a future value and nothing can change it regardless of whether or not it comes back fulfilled or rejected
