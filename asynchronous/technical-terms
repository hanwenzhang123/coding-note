Async: Several blocks of code can run at the same time. One call doesn't stop program's execution
Sync: Only one block can run at at time
JavaScript engine - Built in interpreter that executes JS code
call stack - the JavaScript engine is able to keep track of the order of function calls and where it is in a program at any given moment, using a mechanism called:
callback queue - holding area for callbacks that are waiting to be put on the call stack and eventually executed.
callback queue - a list (or line) containing all the async task callbacks waiting to be executed
Event Loop - Any time the call stack is empty, the event loop pushes the first task from the callback queue onto the call stack and runs it.
