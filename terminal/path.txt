What is an absolute path? A path that starts at the root directory


1.
Fill in the blank to complete the command to print the contents of the resume.txt file within the documents directory.

Notice that you are not currently in the documents directory; you will need to include that as part of the path!

treehouse:~/workspace$ ls
documents  games  images
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls documents
profile.txt  resume.txt
treehouse:~/workspace$ cat documents/resume.txt


2.
Fill in the blank to complete a command to change to the macpan directory within the games directory.

Notice that we are currently in the workspace directory. We want to change to the macpan directory in a single command, so you'll need to use a relative path that includes the games directory...

treehouse:~/workspace$ pwd
/home/treehouse/workspace/
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls
documents  games  images
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls games
dugdig  gagala  macpan
treehouse:~/workspace$ cd games/macpan


3.
Change to the root directory.
treehouse:~/workspace$ cd /

4. 
Fill in the blank to complete the command to change to the usr directory within the root directory.
treehouse:~/workspace$ ls /
dev  etc  home  opt  usr
treehouse:~/workspace$ cd /usr
