1. 
Fill in the blank to run macpan.sh within the current directory.

Remember, to run an executable you have to include an absolute or relative path to it. And there's a symbol you can use to specify the current directory...

treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ pwd
/home/treehouse/workspace/games/macpan
treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ ls
macpan.sh
treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ ./macpan.sh

Let's say I was outside a directory named mydir, and I wanted to run a script named myscript.sh inside mydir. I would type:mydir/myscript.sh
Now let's suppose I was inside mydir. To run the same script, I would type:./myscript.sh


2.
We're in the macpan subdirectory within the games directory. Fill in the blank to complete a command to change to the dugdig directory that lives alongside macpan in the games parent directory.

We want to do this in a single command, so you'll need to form a path to the dugdig directory that uses the special symbol for the parent directory.

treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ pwd
/home/treehouse/workspace/games/macpan
treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ ls ..
dugdig  gagala  macpan
treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ cd ../dugdig

3.
Fill in the blank to complete a command to change to the current user's home directory. Use the special symbol that stands for the home directory.
The command to change directory is "cd". And the special symbol that stands for any directory's parent directory is two periods together ("..").



4.
Fill in the blank to complete a command that will change directly to the images subdirectory within the user's home directory. Use the ~ symbol to stand for the home directory.
The goal is to navigate back to the home (~) directory, and then to the images folder.

treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ ls ~
documents  images  games
treehouse:~/workspace/games/macpan$ cd ~/images


5.
Fill in the blank to complete a command that will print the contents of all files within the current directory whose names end in .txt.

treehouse:~/workspace/documents$ ls
addresses.txt  form.pdf  profile.txt  resume.txt
treehouse:~/workspace$ cat *.txt
